Rewrite the stars is the school project created at the Generative Design Programming at FI MUNI. 

It's based on the idea that everyone is composed of stardust; therefore, each of us is a unique star cluster. Also, we have the power to influence the shape of other things and the ability to create. Kinect captures the human figure, and this figure is composed of thousands of stars. There is one star, which is the beginning of creation. Users can catch this star and star connecting their constellation, not limited by straight lines.
